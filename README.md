This is a simple Todo application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows you to **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** tasks. The tasks are stored in the **Local Storage** of the browser, so the data persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.

- **Create**: Add new todo items.
- **Read**: View the list of tasks.
- **Update**: Edit the existing tasks.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: All data is saved locally in your browser, so your tasks will remain intact even if you refresh the page or restart the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styling the Todo app for better UI.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for managing tasks and handling Local Storage.

## How to Use
